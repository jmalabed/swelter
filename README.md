SWELTER is here to bridge the last gap for surf notifications.
Other applications give forecasts. They do a very good job on the incoming swell, but lack granularity when it comes to specific wave forecasts that are currently at a certain location.

SWELTER scrapes data from a buoy and then checks the swell period/ sends push notifications when it is deemed "FIRING".
